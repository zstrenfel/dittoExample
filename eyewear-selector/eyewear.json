Some people are dumb and also think that the Pacific Ocean isn't on a world map (true story 30% of Americans couldn't locate it!) These Stark aviator frames take the \"computer nerd\" look and bring it into the 21st century. Smart in more than ways than one, looks like Arthur from IT just went up on the hotness scale. *We would like to clarify there is no actual scientific hotness scale.</p>",
